# ðŸ“Š Python for Risk & Investment Banking

This repository contains my learning progress in **Python programming** applied to **Risk, Finance, and Investment**.  
It combines exercises from [Harvard CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/) and [MOOC.fi Python Course](https://programming-25.mooc.fi/) with small finance projects and explorations of open-source finance libraries.
